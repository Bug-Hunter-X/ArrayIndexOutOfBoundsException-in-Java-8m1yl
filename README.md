# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common error in Java: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The example code attempts to access an array element outside the valid index range.  The solution shows how to correct the error by using the proper loop condition to avoid accessing elements beyond the array's bounds.

The bug is in the `bug.java` file, and the solution is in the `bugSolution.java` file.
